These TNMs include information pertaining to product updates, format changes, new attributes, detailed attribute specifications and representations, and new country coverage announcements. If HERE plans to add, remove, or change an attribute or product Layer, an announcement is made to customers a minimum of 6 months in advance. This allows customers to prepare and make necessary modifications to their applications before a new attribute is released in the product.</logic><complete>HERE includes 4 levels of street map coverage: Prime, Complete, Network, and City-to-City. Prime is HERE's highest level of coverage.  This coverage level has the most detail and enables door-to-door routing functionality. Complete is a level of coverage, which is source dependent. It is the coverage level used for links that are not field verified and are flagged with the In-Process Data attribute = Y. Network coverage includes the main highway network and all the necessary attributes required to allow routing from city to city. Network links are coded with Detailed City Inclusion attribute = N and In-Process Data attribute = N. For Network links, the Full Geometry flag may be set to either yes or no depending on the presence or lack of surrounding In-Process Data Coverage. The City-to-City specification enables HERE to maintain minimum coverage in areas prior to completing Prime, Network, or In- Process areas. Examples include: major roads only in a country where there is no existing coverage, major roads to a city in a country where there is currently no other existing coverage, or major roads between existing DC/Prime, IT/Network, or In-Process areas. In many countries, HERE has used a commercial source to add local roads to the Inter-Town network. The inclusion of this geometry allows improved map display and guidance. This coverage level is called Full Coverage in the U.S. and Road Network Coverage in Europe. The Connector Specification enables HERE to maintain minimum coverage in areas prior to completing (full) Prime, Network/Inter Town (IT), or In-Process areas. For defining a hierarchical network used to determine a logical and efficient route for a traveler, each map street segment is tagged with a 5 level Functional Class (FC) attribute explained as follows. FC 1: Very long distance routes between major cities - The "highest level" network comprises the FC 1 arterials, which are primarily controlled access highways designed for very-long-distance travel linking major metropolitan areas and cities, FC 2: Primary routes between major and smaller cities and through metro areas, FC 3: Major routes between minor cities or towns, and through city districts, FC 4: Routes connecting minor towns or villages and collecting the local traffic in the city districts, and FC 5: Roads that are not efficient through routes - The "lowest level" and final category is FC 5, which comprises roads not considered to be arterials or transportation corridors.</complete><posacc><horizpa><horizpar>Boundaries for cartographic features may be generalized. Generalisation refers to the process of reusing existing links when cartography and administrative boundaries are created. If existing geometry is within the generalization guidelines below, then the feature is added to the existing links instead of creating additional geometry. Roads and ferries cannot share geometry with railways, runways, country boundaries, or any water links. Additionally, Building/Landmark polygons which require sufficient detail to make the building recognisable, can never share geometry with navigable links. All other cartography may share geometry based on the generalisation rules. For example, a road link or railroad link may also have a feature of state park or hospital. Cartography and administrative boundary features in Detailed City areas can be generalised up to 25 metres/82 feet (except built-up areas) and 100 metres/328 feet for built-up areas Cartography and administrative boundary features in Inter-Town areas can be  eneralised up to 250 metres/820 feet (except built-up areas) 100 metres/328 feet for built-up areas.</horizpar></horizpa></posacc><lineage><procstep><procdesc>HERE File Geodatabase Plus is assembled from the following data sources: HERE North America FGDB, HERE Traffic Patterns, HERE Postal Code Boundaries, and HERE enhanced network routing and geocoding data entities and locators.</procdesc><procdate>Unknown</procdate></procstep><procstep><procdesc>Using proprietary tools and processes, HERE collects road geometry and approximately 400 road attributes.

This attribute makes all of the links or cartographic features meeting the expanded inclusion criteria easily identifiable. It allows for the option to not publish these links/ features if the inclusion causes size issues. Can be used to differentiate links included only for limited use from those published with limited use attribution. For example, when a portion of a hiking trail shares geometry with an unpaved road for use by autos, only those links dedicated for hiking are indicated for limited use only. Note: Features that exceed the standard size requirement do not receive Expanded Inclusion. However, features that are flagged as Expanded Inclusion at a lower Coverage Indicator level retain the Expanded Inclusion flag when the Coverage Indicator gets upgraded to a higher level where the Standard Inclusion size overlaps with that of the Expanded Inclusion. For example, if a lake feature flagged with Expanded Inclusion in Canada has a Coverage Indicator value of N4 and is upgraded to N0, it maintains the Expanded Inclusion flag regardless of meeting standard inclusion size for Coverage Indicator value = N0. If the Expanded Inclusion attribute does not apply to the link or cartographic feature, the attribute is not published. Prior to the Expanded Inclusion initiative, Bridges and Tunnels were only included in the database if they are at least 200 metres in length. Expanded Inclusion allows for Bridges and Tunnels between 5 and 200 metres to be included (if they are significant). These newly included Bridges and Tunnels will have the Expanded Inclusion attribute applied.</attrdef><attrdefs>HERE</attrdefs><attrdomv><edom><edomv>NULL</edomv><edomvd>No Value</edomvd><edomvds>HERE</edomvds></edom></attrdomv><attrdomv><edom><edomv>1</edomv><edomvd>Meets expanded inclusion</edomvd><edomvds>HERE</edomvds></edom></attrdomv><attrdomv><edom><edomv>5</edomv><edomvd>Park (City/County)</edomvd><edomvds>HERE</edomvds></edom></attrdomv><attrdomv><edom><edomv>7</edomv><edomvd>Woodland</edomvd><edomvds>HERE</edomvds></edom></attrdomv></attr><attr><attrlabl>ISO_COUNTRY_CODE</attrlabl><attrdef>ISO Country Code - A three-letter country code as defined by the International Organization for Standardization.
