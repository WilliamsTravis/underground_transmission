Note: Current specifications provide coding for Reversible Links, however the lane counting is duplicated for reversible links. The double lane counting for reversible links is sub-optimal for display related lane-level content like Lane Marking. This specification provides an enhanced model to resolve the lane counting issue for reversible links.</td>

        <td>Expanded Inclusion</td>
        <td width="400">Identifies cartographic features or links that meet the expanded inclusion criteria. This attribute makes all of the links or cartographic features meeting the expanded inclusion criteria easily identifiable. It allows for the option to not publish these links/ features if the inclusion causes size issues. Can be used to differentiate links included only for limited use from those published with limited use attribution. For example, when a portion of a hiking trail shares geometry with an unpaved road for use by autos, only those links dedicated for hiking are indicated for limited use only. Note: Features that exceed the standard size requirement do not receive Expanded Inclusion. However, features that are flagged as Expanded Inclusion at a lower Coverage Indicator level retain the Expanded Inclusion flag when the Coverage Indicator gets upgraded to a higher level where the Standard Inclusion size overlaps with that of the Expanded Inclusion. For example, if a lake feature flagged with Expanded Inclusion in Canada has a Coverage Indicator value of N4 and is upgraded to N0, it maintains the Expanded Inclusion flag regardless of meeting standard inclusion size for Coverage Indicator value = N0. If the Expanded Inclusion attribute does not apply to the link or cartographic feature, the attribute is not published. Prior to the Expanded Inclusion initiative, Bridges and Tunnels were only included in the database if they are at least 200 metres in length. Expanded Inclusion allows for Bridges and Tunnels between 5 and 200 metres to be included (if they are significant). These newly included Bridges and Tunnels will have the Expanded Inclusion attribute applied.</td>
