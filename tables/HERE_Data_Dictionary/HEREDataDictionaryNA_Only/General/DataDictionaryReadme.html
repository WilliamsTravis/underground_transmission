<h3>The HERE File Geodabase Plus Data Dictionary</h3> 

This HTML based data dictionary describes HERE File Geodabase Plus geospatial data layers for North America. It was developed by HERE in order to: 
<ul>

<li>Provide a streamlined yet comprehensive description of the File Geodabase Plus data product.</li> 

<li>Provide a single access point, lightweight HTML front-end to the most essential information and metadata needed by an end user to rapidly assess the potential value of data for a particular purpose and get started using it.</li>

<li>Provide the details required to help end users easily and quickly make the best use of HERE data for creating map displays, classifications, labeling, filtering, reports, and graphs.</li> 

<li>Ensure that users needing to create ArcMap .mxd documents have very clear information describing layer/table types, attribute data types, lengths, and  allowed values, geodatabase domains, and relationships.</li>  
</ul>

The information presented in this data dictionary was compiled and integrated primarily from HERE's File Geodatabase Reference Manual, as well as additional information about supplemental data from HERE technical customer support, HERE documentation, FGDC metadata, and the data itself.  
 
<h3>Data Dictionary Organization</h3>

The main menu links at the top of each data dictionary HTML page include:
<ul>

<li><b>Read Me:</b> Provides a basic overview of the data dictionary and an overall description of main links and content.</li>  

<li><b>Overview:</b> Describes the most essential and important aspects of File Geodabase Plus data.</li> 

<li><b>Layers/Tables:</b> Provides full descriptions of all File Geodabase Plus layers, tables, attributes, and lookup table values. 
    From the main Layers/Tables page, users can drill down to review attribute descriptions. 
    From a Layer or Table's Attribute page, users can drill down to review Lookup Table values.</li>
 
<li><b>Facility/Feature Finder:</b> As a single File Geodabase Plus layer may contain multiple feature types, and the same feature type may be found in multiple layers, this table helps end users find the layers and attributes name=value pairs needed for defining specific feature based map displays, classifications, labels, and reports.</li> 

<li><b>Relationships:</b> The ESRI File Geodatabase style relationships among features and tables, including the direction and cardinality of the relationship.</li> 

<li><b>Map Types:</b> A list of all countries included in the File Geodatabase Plus data, the HERE region geodatabase the country is found in, and its HERE map type.</li> 

<li><b>Admin Levels:</b> A list of all administrative geography names used in HERE's multi-level area classification system.</li> 
 
<li><b>Dictionary Reference:</b> Provides detailed definitions of the data dictionary fields used to describe Layers, Tables, Attributes, and Lookup Tables.</li>
</ul>

<b>Note: To enable HTML table sorting, browsers need to be set to allow script running.</b>
