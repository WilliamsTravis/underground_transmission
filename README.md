# Notes on SSURGO Data
We are using the vector datasets, but to get the attribute tables without Microsoft Access we are pulling some items from the gridded (gSSURGO) product. So, we'll need to download all the files from the CONUS gSSURGO public Box account from the NRCS: https://nrcs.app.box.com/v/soils/folder/. Put this is data/ssurgo.
